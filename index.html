                    <p class="text-faded">
                        Cindy Kovatch is a designer, lover and collector of antiques, and a fellow creative from Lancaster, Ohio. She has one of the biggest hearts and most amazing spirits of anyone I have ever met. This shoot is being put together as a benefit to help her and her family in their time of need, and every penny will go for that purpose only.  <br><br>

                        Cindy is also an amazing mother of three who has faced widowhood twice due to cancer and is desperately attempting to save her beautiful "Serenity Farm" and support her children until the youngest graduates. She is selling off many of her antiques and holding back the most unique items to start a new prop and venue rental business venture in the hopes that this will allow her to continue to support her amazing kids, and keep their beloved farm a little longer. She is also extremely talented with staging and design and will be offering those services as well. PLEASE consider helping her to keep the roof over their heads, the beautiful land they live on, and to get acquainted with the models, photographers, and other creatives in this field who would love to utilize her services and network with her in her new venture.<br><br>

                        In return for your donation, Cindy is graciously allowing the use of her entire farm, the exterior of her beautiful 1860's home, and her collection of 100's of props and antique furniture for this event. This is an amazing opportunity to have a chance to use this location and these items for a minimal donation. We all know how much venues and props can run for even a few hours of use!

                        <br><br>

                        **MEETING PLACE** - The beautiful 1860's "Serenity Farm" located at 3851 Lancaster-Thornville Rd. Lancaster, Ohio! JUNE 17th 7am-8pm<br><br>

                        Cindy has  8 beautiful acres with several wooded areas, a bridge, small stream, stone seating, bonfire circle, tire swing, wooden swing, a huge bank barn with staged areas, several outbuildings, an 1860's home with columns and a beautiful exterior with two balconies, a fenced in area with a perfect "cemetery" atmosphere, and 100's of antiques and props. The theme of the shoot is Vintage Fantasies and Nightmares - but photographers and models are free to create their own ideas and styles. <br><br>

                        The cost of attending is a minimum $ 25 donation for models, $35 for photographers.  This will allow you access to hundreds of props, antiques, staged areas, and gorgeous locations for your photographs to have that extra flair.  *In the future, Cindy will be charging by piece, as well as for the venue, so this is an excellent chance for a lot of creativity to happen for a minimal donation. <br><br>

                        Hair and makeup artists $15 minimum donation. <br><br>

                        - This will be a GREAT event for NETWORKING, as Cindy is looking forward to serving brides, families, photographers, etc. in her venture and will be in need of both makeup artists and photographers to refer her clients to. <br><br>

                        <b>NOTE:</b><br> For those of you who would love to do this, but the date won't work, or even for those who want more than one chance at this opportunity, a donation of $125 will lock in your ability to set up a date to do a full day of shooting at your convenience (with as many sessions as you can schedule that day) at this location and with full access to props at no additional charge. <br><br>

                        PLEASE do not schedule with photographers or models if you have not yet made a contribution! We will be setting up PayPal for the donations for this event in the next few days and will be keeping track of those who have donated.<br><br>

                        MAKE-UP ARTISTS<br>
                        Please post on the page regarding your rates! There will be an area with electricity set up for you to utilize. This is an excellent networking opportunity as well.<br><br>

                        PHOTOGRAPHERS<br>
                        You are encouraged to go with your own style and visions. Although we are requesting no nudity, implied is ok. Please remember to keep it classy, as all ages are welcome.<br><br>

                        This is a trade benefit event so please communicate with the models what they can expect from you. We request that models receive at least 5 edited shots posted here on the event page as soon as is possible after the event (we understand it is a busy month, but please keep models updated). As for other negotiations, ie watermark or no watermark, how many outfit changes there will be, additional photos, etc. please negotiate with your models. If you have them, we recommend bringing a release. These additional negotiations will be between you and the model, and we will not set expectations and deadlines on them. PLEASE stay in communication with the models after the shoot. We also will love behind the scenes photos!<br><br>

                        Also, please remember to credit Cindy's business when giving credits on photos. :) <br><br>

                        MODELS<br>
                        We have requested that after the event, models will receive the 5 best edited images to be posted here in the group event page. Any other negotiations over photos will be between model and the photographer. Also, please remember to credit Cindy's business when giving credits on photos. :) <br><br>

                        Feel free to roam around and hang out, there will be food, friends and fun! Though the theme is Vintage Fantasies and Nightmares- Bring any style of clothing and go ham!<br><br>

                        WARDROBE<br>
                        We are working on having someone there with vintage wardrobe, and there may be others who choose to bring theirs. A wardrobe person's product is not expected to be "giveaways" and the wardrobe person is welcome to sell their product at the event. A wardrobe person can also rent their wares..<br><br>

                        FOOD<br> We plan on this being a potluck event, so please let us know what you would be willing to bring. There will also be a bonfire for warming up and taking a break if need be. <br><br>

                        PETS<br>
                        Please don't bring your pets along - but there will be two friendly cats who live at the farm. Be aware, they do love to photobomb at times! :)  <br><br>

                        INTERIOR SHOOTING<br>
                        The interior area for shooting is the barn. Electricity will be available.<br><br>

                        NUDE SHOOTING<br>
                        No nude shooting, but implied shooting is allowed. We ask photographers to always show respect. Any reported pressuring, persuasive overtly sexual language, or harassment of any kind will result in dismissal from the event.<br><br>

                        RAIN DATE<br>
                        We will set a rain date if this one does not work.<br><br>
